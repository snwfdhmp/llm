# llm : use any LLM from the command line

> This is still a work in progress. Features are subject to change and not all features are implemented yet.

## Concept

llm is a CLI that allows you to use any LLM from the command line.
It is built as a frontend that is not tied to any specific LLM, and can be used with any LLM.
Its goal is to simplify querying LLMs from the command line or using scripts.
